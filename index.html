                <h2>Aspiring Web Developer based in New York</h2>
                <p>
                    I choose to be a web developer simply because I love seeing my imagination come to life. When I was 15, I started building simple websites in geocities and tinkering CSS in multiply. I loved looking at beautiful websites and imagine how I can recreate it as my inspired version.
                    
                    After eight years of working as a computer systems analyst in Silicon Valley and a year of learning data science, AWS architecture and mobile development, I've come to realize that frontend web development is still my passion. I've recently upgraded my JS, HTML & CSS development skills with Scrimba, learned React, custom hooks and reusable & styled components. I'm excited to create more React projects and start a software development career with it.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <strong><small>Hi my name is Gian Carlo Torres, you can call me Gian. I am based in Brooklyn, in New York and have been pursuing a career in frontend engineering for more than two years now.</small></strong>
                <p>I’ve decided to join this bootcamp, so I’d be able to focus on this career change full-time. Before the pandemic hit, I was a computer systems analyst in the South Bay Area, and realized it was not something that I want to do. I moved to NYC with my partner and completed various self-paced certifications including Python for Data Analysts, React Native Mobile Development and even a Solutions Architect Associate from Amazon Web Services - my goals were a little scattered LOL. My most recent certification is Frontend Web Development. I finally decided to pursue a career out of it because I fell in love with React. I still would consider my current portfolio as “not good enough” and a prospective senior software engineer harshly described it as “pedestrian”, so I believe I need more experience and that’s why I’ve enrolled on this bootcamp program. Outside of my career, I love working out, hiking in the outdoors, traveling to other continents, mixing cocktails and trying out new recipes. I am an outside hitter for my indoor volleyball team, as well!</p>
